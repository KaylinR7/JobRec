# 🔧 Login Issue Fix Guide

## 🚨 Problem Identified
Your app couldn't login as student or company because:
- Firebase Firestore has user data but Firebase Authentication doesn't have the corresponding user accounts
- Admin login works because it has special logic to create the Firebase Auth user if it doesn't exist

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: Automatic Test Account Creation (IMPLEMENTED)
I've modified your `LoginActivity.kt` to automatically create test accounts when you try to login with the correct test credentials.

### Solution 2: Manual Firebase Console Setup (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. **Select your project**: `careerworx-f5bc6`
3. **Navigate to**: Authentication > Users
4. **Add these test users manually**:

## 🔐 Test Login Credentials

### 📚 Students
- **Email**: `john.doe@example.com` | **Password**: `password123`
- **Email**: `jane.smith@example.com` | **Password**: `password123`

### 🏢 Companies  
- **Email**: `hr@techcorp.com` | **Password**: `password123`
- **Email**: `hr@businesssolutions.com` | **Password**: `password123`

### 👨‍💼 Admin
- **Email**: `admin@careerworx.com` | **Password**: `admin123`

## 🚀 How to Test

### Option A: Use the Automatic Creation (Easiest)
1. Open your app
2. Try to login with any of the test credentials above
3. Select the correct user type (Student/Company)
4. If the account doesn't exist, the app will create it automatically
5. You'll see a message "Test account created! Please login again."
6. Login again with the same credentials

### Option B: Manual Setup in Firebase Console
1. Go to Firebase Console > Authentication > Users
2. Click "Add user"
3. Enter the email and password from the list above
4. Repeat for all test accounts
5. Then login normally in your app

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

The issue was in the authentication flow:
1. App tries to authenticate with Firebase Auth first
2. If user doesn't exist in Firebase Auth → Login fails immediately
3. Even though user data exists in Firestore, it never gets checked

## 🛠️ Technical Changes Made

1. **Modified `LoginActivity.kt`**:
   - Added `isTestAccount()` function to detect test credentials
   - Added `createTestAccount()` function to create missing Firebase Auth users
   - Enhanced error handling to automatically create test accounts

2. **Updated `setup-firestore-data.js`**:
   - Added Firebase Auth user creation alongside Firestore documents
   - Added proper error handling for existing users

## 📱 Testing Steps

1. **Build and run your app**
2. **Try logging in as a student**:
   - Email: `john.doe@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Select "Student" radio button
3. **Try logging in as a company**:
   - Email: `hr@techcorp.com`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Select "Company" radio button

## 🎯 Expected Results

- ✅ Student login should redirect to `HomeActivity`
- ✅ Company login should redirect to `CompanyDashboardActivityNew`
- ✅ Admin login should redirect to `AdminDashboardActivity`
- ✅ If test account doesn't exist, it will be created automatically

## 🚨 Important Notes

- The automatic account creation only works for the predefined test accounts
- For production, users should register through the signup flow
- Test accounts are created with minimal data - you can enhance profiles later
- All test accounts use simple passwords for testing purposes

## 🔄 If Issues Persist

1. **Check Firebase Console**: Verify users are created in Authentication section
2. **Check Logs**: Look for error messages in Android Studio logcat
3. **Clear App Data**: Settings > Apps > Your App > Storage > Clear Data
4. **Rebuild Project**: Build > Clean Project, then Build > Rebuild Project

Your login issue should now be resolved! 🎉
