## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have:

1. **Node.js installed** on your system
2. **Firebase project set up** with the correct configuration
3. **Sample users and companies** created (run `setup-data.js` first if not done)
4. **Internet connection** to connect to Firebase

2. Download the LTS version for your operating system
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions
4. Verify installation by running: `node --version` and `npm --version`

**Option 2: Using package managers**
- **Windows (with Chocolatey)**: `choco install nodejs`
- **Windows (with Winget)**: `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS`
- **macOS (with Homebrew)**: `brew install node`
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**: `sudo apt install nodejs npm`

## How to Run

   ```

## Verifying the Events

After running the script, you can verify the events were created by:

1. **Opening the Android app**
2. **Logging in as a student** (john.doe@example.com or jane.smith@example.com)
3. **Going to the Calendar tab**
4. **Checking the "Tomorrow's Events" section**
5. **Logging in as a company** (hr@techcorp.com or hr@businesssolutions.com)
6. **Going to the Company Calendar**
7. **Checking the "Tomorrow's Interviews" section**

## Database Structure

Events are stored in the `calendar_events` collection in Firestore with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  userId: "user1" | companyId: "company1",
  title: "Event Title",
  description: "Event Description",
  date: Timestamp (tomorrow's date),
  time: "9:00 AM",
  duration: 90, // minutes
  meetingType: "online" | "in-person",
  location: "Location for in-person meetings",
  meetingLink: "Link for online meetings",
  notes: "Additional notes",
  isInterview: true | false,
  jobId: "job1", // if interview
  companyId: "company1", // if interview
  status: "scheduled",
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**If you get Firebase connection errors:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the Firebase configuration in the script
- Make sure the Firebase project is active

**If events don't appear in the app:**
- Make sure you're logged in as the correct user
- Check that the date calculation is correct
- Verify the events were created in Firestore console

**If you want to run the script multiple times:**
- The script will create duplicate events each time it's run
- You may want to clear the `calendar_events` collection first
