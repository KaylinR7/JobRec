# Stricter Job Matching Algorithm Changes

## Overview
The job matching algorithm has been made significantly stricter to ensure only highly relevant jobs receive high match scores. This addresses the issue of irrelevant jobs getting inflated scores.

## Key Strictness Improvements

### 1. Reduced Maximum Scores
**Field/Specialization Matching:**
- Perfect match: 95% → 90%
- Good match: 85% → 80%
- Fair match: 75% → 65%
- Related fields: 65% → 55%
- Transferable fields: 45% → 35%
- Unrelated fields: 25% → 15%

### 2. Stricter Skills Scoring
**Before:** Generous scoring for partial skill matches
**After:** Requires high skill overlap for good scores

- 90%+ skill match → 85% score (was 90%)
- 70%+ skill match → 75% score (was 80%)
- 50%+ skill match → 60% score (was 70%)
- 30%+ skill match → 45% score (was 60%)
- Any skill match → 30% score (was 50%)
- No skills → 15% score (was 30%)

### 3. Enhanced Skill Requirements
**New Feature:** Minimum skill match requirements for high scores

- Users with 5+ skills need at least 3 matching skills for top scores
- Users with 3+ skills need at least 2 matching skills for top scores
- Users with fewer skills need at least 1 matching skill
- Partial skill matches count as half a match

### 4. Stricter Experience Matching
**Before:** Lenient experience level comparison
**After:** Requires close experience alignment

- Exact experience match: 95% → 90%
- 90% of required experience: New tier at 80%
- 70% of required experience: 85% → 65%
- 50% of required experience: 75% → 45%
- Some experience: 45% → 25%
- No experience: 30% → 10%

### 5. Enhanced Gemini AI Prompt
**Added strict guidelines:**
- Field mismatch should heavily penalize scores (max 60%)
- Missing critical skills should significantly reduce scores
- Experience level mismatch should be heavily weighted
- Only award high scores (80+%) with strong alignment across all criteria

### 6. Increased Recommendation Threshold
**Before:** 60% threshold for recommended jobs
**After:** 70% threshold for recommended jobs

- Only jobs with 70%+ compatibility are shown as recommendations
- Updated UI text to reflect "70%+ compatibility"
- Significantly reduces the number of marginally relevant recommendations

## Expected Impact

### Score Distribution Changes:
- **90-100%:** Only perfect matches with all criteria aligned
- **80-89%:** Excellent matches with strong field and skill alignment
- **70-79%:** Good matches meeting most requirements
- **60-69%:** Fair matches with notable gaps
- **50-59%:** Poor matches with major gaps
- **0-49%:** Very poor matches, not suitable

### User Experience:
- Fewer but more relevant job recommendations
- Higher confidence in match percentages
- Reduced noise from irrelevant job suggestions
- Better quality of recommended jobs

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. **GeminiJobMatchingService.kt**
   - Enhanced prompt with strict scoring guidelines
   - Reduced field matching scores
   - Stricter skills scoring with minimum match requirements
   - More stringent experience matching

2. **JobMatchingService.kt**
   - Aligned rule-based scoring with stricter criteria
   - Reduced maximum scores across all categories

3. **HomeActivity.kt**
   - Increased threshold from 60% to 70%
   - Updated UI text to reflect new threshold

4. **JobMatchingTest.kt**
   - Updated test expectations to match stricter scoring

## Validation

The stricter algorithm ensures:
- Software developers won't match with unrelated jobs like "vape tester"
- Field alignment is the primary determining factor
- Skills must genuinely overlap for high scores
- Experience levels must be reasonably aligned
- Only truly relevant jobs reach the 70%+ recommendation threshold

## Benefits

1. **Higher Quality Recommendations:** Only genuinely relevant jobs are recommended
2. **Improved User Trust:** Match percentages are more meaningful and accurate
3. **Reduced Noise:** Eliminates marginally relevant job suggestions
4. **Better Targeting:** Users see jobs they're actually qualified for
5. **Clearer Expectations:** Higher thresholds set appropriate user expectations

This stricter approach ensures the job matching system provides genuine value by focusing on quality over quantity in job recommendations.
