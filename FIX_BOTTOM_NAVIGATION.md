# Bottom Navigation Fix

## Issue Fixed
The app was crashing with the error:
```
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Maximum number of items supported by BottomNavigationView is 5. Limit can be checked with BottomNavigationView#getMaxItemCount()
```

## Root Cause
The `company_bottom_navigation.xml` menu had 6 items, but Material Design's `BottomNavigationView` only supports a maximum of 5 items.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed AI Assistant from Bottom Navigation
**File**: `app/src/main/res/menu/company_bottom_navigation.xml`
- Removed the 6th menu item (AI Assistant)
- Now has exactly 5 items: Dashboard, Jobs, Applications, Calendar, Profile

### 2. Updated Activity Navigation Handlers
**Files**: 
- `app/src/main/java/com/example/jobrec/CompanyDashboardActivityNew.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/example/jobrec/CompanyDashboardActivity.kt`

Removed the AI Assistant navigation handler from `setupBottomNavigation()` method.

### 3. Added AI Assistant as Quick Action Button
**File**: `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_company_dashboard_new.xml`
- Added a new AI Assistant button in the quick actions section
- Positioned as a centered button below the 2x2 grid of existing buttons

### 4. Added Button Click Handler
**File**: `app/src/main/java/com/example/jobrec/CompanyDashboardActivityNew.kt`
- Added click handler for the new AI Assistant button
- Launches the ChatbotActivity when clicked

## Result
- ✅ App no longer crashes on company dashboard
- ✅ All 5 navigation items work correctly
- ✅ AI Assistant functionality preserved via quick action button
- ✅ Maintains Material Design guidelines

## How to Test
1. Clean and rebuild the project
2. Log in as a company user (hr@techcorp.com or hr@businesssolutions.com)
3. Navigate to company dashboard
4. Verify bottom navigation has 5 items and works
5. Verify AI Assistant button in quick actions works

## Build Commands
```bash
# Clean the project
./gradlew clean

# Rebuild
./gradlew build
```

## Files Modified
- `app/src/main/res/menu/company_bottom_navigation.xml`
- `app/src/main/java/com/example/jobrec/CompanyDashboardActivityNew.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/example/jobrec/CompanyDashboardActivity.kt`
- `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_company_dashboard_new.xml`

## Note
The student navigation (`bottom_nav_menu.xml`) has exactly 5 items and should not have this issue.
